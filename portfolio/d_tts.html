				<h3>Partner : Product manager, RD Team.</h3>
				<p>
					This project entails three key objectives: swiftly identifying the market fit for the new AI-based
					algorithm, developing a solution that caters to user needs while leveraging available R&D resources,
					and
					formulating a comprehensive business strategy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposed solution is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that harnesses cutting-edge deep learning
					technology. It enables effortless integration into any speech-enabled application or device,
					delivering
					lifelike Mandarin Chinese voice synthesis that closely resembles native speech, requiring minimal
					effort.

			<h2>First, to find the characteristics of our AI algorithm, </br>know how it works, and what users can do
				with
				it.
			</h2>
			<p>
				We can see AI reproduce someone's voice in some videos or movies, just like the Netflix documentary
				series“Andy Warhol Diaries” recreated the artist's voice with AI, making us think this technique seems
				familiar. But creating an AI model is different, expensive, and time-consuming. In the past, it was
				almost a privilege for a celebrity.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project begins with an innovative clone voice AI algorithm that the RD team developed.<br>
				The characteristics of this AI algorithm is the speed of create a model and the small count of corpus (a
				small amount of data)
			</p>

			<h2>Build minimum viable products to find the market needs</h2>
			<p>
				The first problem with this project is that the development time is too slow to support this type of
				project, and at the end of the project must roll out a complete application. But we need a simple
				prototype to explore the market and verify whether our core functions are in need. To solve this
				problem, I through the following adjustment to accelerate the development.
			</p>
			<h3>1. Define the market we want to explore, detailed specifications and priorities:</h3>
			<p>
				Make choosing or sorting the features more logical in the roadmap or PRD based on the market. </br>
				In terms of market segmentation, through sales feedback, we define two target markets to test the
				prototype:
			</p>
			<div class="line_area mb-xs">
				<p>
					1. a small business ( like YouTubers) </br>
					2. corporation staff ( like News reporters).
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				And we use different sales strategies and create two applications that can meet different scenarios and
				are more accessible to make function trade-offs. Then Small business is through marketing promotion.
				Corporation through sales and BD promotion.
			</p>
			<img>
			<h3>2. Adjust the specifications flexibly with the restriction and reduce the QA cost and schedule</h3>
			<p>
				Build a fast communication workflow, more closely cooperate with the RD team, and adjust the
				specifications, framework, interaction, and other details with difficulty or restriction.<br>
				Re-define which function would be needed to verify, such as how many phone models or browsers could be
				supported.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the above adjustment, the project's NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) can be significantly
				reduced, and the scale of the project will be smaller. This can give PMs more space to open the next
				project for this solution.
			</p>
			<img>
			<div class="session">Based on feedback, put forward a Service Proposal</div>
			<p>Based on the market and sales feedback, we found some potential market demands,
				and we put forward design proposals for this:</p>
			<h3>Proposal 1, Translating with your voice:
				Use the speaker's voice to shorten the distance between the audience in a multilingual situation.</h3>
			<p>Many corporations will use interpreters to dub in international remote conferences/seminars, which are
				becoming more and more during the lockdown.
				But this often leads to feeling apart from the audience. In some situations, they need to use their
				voice to shorten the distance from the audience.</p>
			<img>
			<h3>Proposal 2, Fast voice generation service with a large number of voice actors:
				Provide a secure and dedicated rental, private cloud server with multiple voice actors</h3>
			<p>With the vigorous development of podcasts, the sound economy is on the rise. Many news, magazines, story
				books, and other manuscripts in the market need to be converted into speech by a different voice.</p>
			<img>
			<div class="session">Definition</div>
			<p>Based on the technical feasibility and channel strategy,
				PM selects Proposal 2 as the development direction.</p>
			<p>We definite the function by user journey map and start design.</p>
			<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
			<p class="center">This journey map shows how journalists complete their goals in this service.</p>
			<div class="session">Design</div>
			<h3>GUI & User Flow</h3>
			<img>
			<img>

			<h3>UI for Progressive Web App</h3>
			<p>The design considers the development difficulty and strengthens the interaction of RWD.
				When users want to create a voice with a mobile device, this website-based service has a usage behavior
				similar to that of an APP</p>
