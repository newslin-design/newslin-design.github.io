				<h3>Partner : Product manager, RD Team.</h3>
				<p>

					This project aimed to develop a new product series to expand sales and enter untapped markets. Our
					main focus was to understand user needs, identify market trends, and design functional solutions
					that effectively solve problems. This included designing intuitive product interactions, such as the
					front panel and software user interface.
					<br>
					Through our efforts, this project achieved remarkable success, with the <strong>highest sales volume
						recorded for that year</strong>. Additionally, it received <strong>numerous international
						awards</strong>.
					<br>
					Our product series is a versatile solution that enables users to create professional live events in
					various scenarios, including online events, live lectures, remote conferences, and private
					YouTuber-style shows. It includes two top-grade products and three OEM products, providing a
					comprehensive offering for our customers.

			<h2>In order to gain a deeper understanding of live streaming, </br>
				I explored its essence and define the key
				components.
			</h2>
			<p>
				I conducted extensive research on various types of webcasting and categorized them accordingly. Taking
				into account the historical development and recent changes in the industry, we identified distinct
				stages and outlined the unique characteristics associated with each stage.
				</br>
				Through our analysis, we discovered that two key technical factors play a crucial role in the webcasting
				industry: the level of interaction and equipment expertise. Based on these factors, we found that the
				market offers different solutions catering to varying needs.
				</br>
				Furthermore, our research revealed an interesting trend in the development process. Almost all types of
				live streaming are evolving towards enhanced interactivity and improved broadcast quality for several
				reasons, exemplified by the Program Live Streaming category depicted in the diagram.

			<h2>The Changing Landscape of Live Streaming: Unveiling Three Key Trends</h2>
			<p>
				The three types of change trends in Streaming Live
				By converting the development process into four quadrants, we can see the trend flow more clearly,
				respectively; the old media want to increase its channels to broad participation or interaction by the
				internet. It is towards the right. And the new media recently started to move upward, which means the
				increased demand for equipment and converted programs to broadcast-level programs. Finally, remote
				education and seminar, which are increasing in the covid-19, need improved communication, interaction,
				and rich content, which means the need for equipment requirement and interactivity are increased.
			</p>

			<h2>Taking into consideration the technological capabilities, <br>
				we selected the yellow and blue changes as target audience.<br>
				Our objective was to assist this audience in successfully navigating
				the challenges of cross-border operations.
			</h2>
			<p>
				Live streaming looks simple, but there are very complex technologies behind it.<br>
				We can see from the technical analysis chart that the interaction technology is mainly in the hands of
				the platform, which is not our strength. Still, integrating the relative front-end devices is our
				strength, so we focus on the content and equipment.<br>
				Based on the existing technology capabilities, excluding the incompetent interactions, We chose the
				yellow and blue colors in the above matrix as the target audience. We aimed to help them complete the
				cross-border.
			</p>

			<h2>But the cross-border movement is strenuous;
				Increasing the equipment and industry knowledge required is challenging in the third quadrant.</h2>
			<p>
				Nowadays, most people start live streaming directly from a cell phone or laptop, but if you want to go
				to the next level, you will encounter many technical difficulties at once
			</p>

			<div class="session">Problem discovery and solution</div>
			<h2>From the targeted users in the above scenario, <br>
				we have identified pain points related to equipment set-up and live operation.</h2>
			<img id class="left mb-sm" style="max-width: 600px;">
			<h3>Q1. Difficulty in hardware installation</h3>
			<p>
				The number of devices is exponentially increasing, and different video and audio sources require
				different cables and adapter devices, so setting up the devices will require more professional
				knowledge. In addition, the number of pieces of equipment connected is easy to make mistakes during live
				streaming.
			</p>
			<h3>Q2. Lack of professional staff and knowledge to do an excellent job of program content</h3>
			<p>
				To make good programming, it needs professional functions and knowledge of the broadcasting industry, as
				well as the support of experienced staff such as directors, sound controllers, and graphic stuff
			</p>
			<h3>Q3. Don't know how to LIVE where you want to be</h3>
			<p>
				This is the responsibility of the Master control in the traditional broadcasting industry, controlling
				its many channels, which requires a great deal of professional knowledge.
			</p>
			<h2 class="box mb-0 mt-lg">Q1. Difficulty in hardware installation :</h2>
			<h2 class="hightlight"> Integration of a large number of professional hardware equipment</h2>
			<p>
				Professional live streaming requires many devices; we work with the PM to develop a corresponding i/o to
				complete all functions in one machine, significantly reducing the difficulty of connecting devices.
				Take the following picture as an example of a music teaching situation. Initially, many devices were
				needed, including Video capturers, Audio mixers, Audio interfaces, Controler, etc., and professional
				hardware knowledge was required.
				However, afterward, we only need to connect all the devices we want to broadcast to one device to
				complete the installation.

			<h2 class="box mb-0 mt-lg">Q2. Lack of professional staff and knowledge to do an excellent job of program
				content</h2>
			<h2 class="hightlight">1. Easy but professional directing function</h2>
			<p>
				Make the professional director's preview and switching function easier, allowing users to easily switch
				and monitor each screen through their iPad or computer.
			</p>
			<img class="left">
			<h2>2. Converted programs to broadcast level programs</h2>
			<p>
				Innovative scene-based operations reduce the need for streaming live workforce to achieve
				broadcast-quality programming.
				Easy to use word cards and complete multi-camera screen processing.
			</p>
			<img class="left">
			<h2>3. Simplify audio mixer functionality and add automated features</h2>
			<p>Intuitive user interface with many defaults for novice users and features for advanced users. For
				directors, we provide an audio-follow-video function to reduce the workload</p>
			<img class="left">
			<h2 class="box mb-0 mt-lg">Q3. Don't know how to LIVE where you want to be:</h2>
			<h2 class="hightlight">Offers multiple easy-to-use streaming channelss</h2>
			<p>Integrate common live streaming channels and stream them through a simple UI, including support for
				Oauth, Stream key RTDP, and common online platforms, and also help customize live streaming to other
				platforms</p>
