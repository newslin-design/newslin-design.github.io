			<h3>Python / Chat GPT API</h3>
			<div class="session">Background</div>
			<h2>Can AI be harnessed to streamline research data handling, especially when dealing with vast amounts of
				audiovisual data and specialized terms?</h2>
			<p>After conducting research interviews, we realized that researchers are confronted with a substantial
				amount of audiovisual data, including numerous specialized terms, necessitating significant human
				resources for integration. To address this issue, we plan to integrate current open-source AI models and
				attempt to develop a solution that ensures the privacy and security of data. This endeavor aims to
				enhance data processing efficiency while guaranteeing the accurate handling and consolidation of
				specialized terminology. I believe this solution will have a positive impact on research efforts.
