			<p>From Windows Phone and Android smartphones to VR, HTC has always been a technological leader in the
				industry. What could be the next step for HTC in the future? This plan is considering how to use HTC's
				current brand value and product line to think about the next possible direction. In the past two years,
				many companies that started with software have been moving towards hardware development, such as
				Microsoft's Surface series and Google's various innovative products. It is evident that in today's era
				of flourishing software development, the hardware devices that support this software will become
				increasingly important. HTC, starting from ODM, also maintains certain advantages in production.
				Currently, in many fields, the application of robots is being discussed. Consumer robots like Zenbo and
				Pepper are products where artificial intelligence can independently assist human life. However, HTC
				could combine the advantages of smartphones and VR to develop another possibility: Viver, positioned as
				another body for users. It can use the powerful interactive features of VIVE to remotely operate robots
				and interact with the environment and people in another domain. Viver could propose a new concept of
				transportation to the world in the future â€“ replacing physical movement with the movement of
				consciousness and senses.</p>

						[Trend of technology entering the education market] Education and learning have always been
						crucial to human progress. In recent years, various technological advancements have been
						introduced into the classroom education market, updating education models that haven't changed
						much in hundreds of years. From the free online open courses (Open Course MOOCs) initiated by
						MIT in 2002 to this year's Google Classroom and Microsoft's Surface Laptop designed for the
						education market, it's evident that the education market is undergoing a prolonged technological
						revolution, with VR not missing from this revolution.
						[Target Group] Educational institutions, universities, high schools, and other educational
						groups.
						[Problems Viver aims to solve] Unrealistic, non-immersive, and low interactive remote teaching
						experiences.
						The cost of time and money for remote education, such as cross-national academic teaching,
						architecture, exhibitions.
						Remote teaching in dangerous or hard-to-reach environments, such as mountain area guide
						training, volcanic academic research, driving training.

					<h3>On-site visual/auditory experiences in remote areas.</h3>
					<p class="pb-md">Accompanying VR equipment with camera and sound recording devices. Viver's head can
						move left,
						right, up, down, forward, and backward, allowing remote VR users to feel immersive and letting
						those interacting with Viver sense the VR user's head posture. E.g., leaning forward, nodding.
					</p>
					<h3>Interactive screen</h3>
					<p class="pb-md">Interactive screen for enhanced interaction between Viver and remote users.</p>
					<h3>New experiences in remote free movement.</h3>
					<p>Equipped with wheels for movement, allowing the VR user to move Viver and interact with space.
						The current model is for flat terrain; for rugged or uneven surfaces, the lower part can be
						replaced with different wheels.</p>

						with one Viver for multiple students.
						Viver can serve students/public who need remote viewing at museums, exhibition halls, research
						sites, and fixed educational venues. It can be one student per Viver, or one Viver for multiple
						students using the Vive room, where the teacher controls and explains in real-time, interacting
						with space through Viver.</p>
