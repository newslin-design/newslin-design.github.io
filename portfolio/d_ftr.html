			<h2>With the accelerating digitization, teachers need new training room solutions.</h2>
			<p>
				With the advancement of technology and accelerating digitization, teaching and knowledge transmission
				methods are becoming more and more diverse. The teaching site has gradually changed from traditional
				one-way knowledge content transmission to multiple ideological interactions, such as workshops, group
				discussions, Remote cooking classes, and Remote field education.
			</p>
			<p>
				With more and more interactions in the classroom, the dependence on many digital devices and software
				will become deeper and deeper, which is a new challenge for teachers and classroom managers.<br>
				With this project, the company not only meets the needs of teachers but also hopes to become an
				indicator of future classroom solutions launched by the company.
			</p>
			<p>
				And we aim to achieve fast and high-quality connection through our products to digitize interaction
				without threshold. Through the control system, we can freely allocate and control all equipment to
				reduce the difficulty of learning how to use it. Eliminate the high wall between equipment, teachers,
				and students, and combine more third-party applications to achieve a borderless classroom that can
				interact across every space.
			</p>
			<img style="max-width: 1200px;">
			<div class="session">Define requirements</div>
			<p>
				Through interviews with classroom teachers, we define various situations and user journeys.<br>
				And with workshops, we explore new ways of application that meet the needs of users.

					<h3>Lecture-based teaching (including remote mode)</h3>
					<p>
						Lecture-based teaching can meet the traditional teaching style of most lecturers. In addition to
						perfect information presentation, many new communication methods are added, such as video
						recording, timely voting, questioning system, etc. This lowers the communication threshold
						between teachers and students, facilitates the unification of student opinions, increases the
						willingness of remote students to interact, and allows more communication and knowledge
						collision in the traditional classroom style.
